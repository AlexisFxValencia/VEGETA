# VEGETA

A very light app to plot MORET, SERPENT and MCNP Geometries and export them as 3D files.

If you just want to use it without downloading it, use this URL : file:///Y:/VEGETA/index.html

## Getting started

Just download the VEGETA folder and open index.html with your browser (Firefox or Chrome eg).
Write your MORET/SERPENT text (or Browse to the file) on the left and click on "Plot from input file". 
Don't forget to choose the right code (MORET, SERPENT,...) on top of the page. 

The test files are in the JDD folder.
