# VEGETA

A very light app to plot MORET, SERPENT and openMC Geometries and export them as 3D files.


## Getting started

Access VEGETA on : https://alexisfxvalencia.github.io/VEGETA/
Computation is locally performed, no data is sent to the server.

If you want to use it offline :
Just download the whole project and open index.html with your browser (Firefox or Chrome eg).
Write your MORET/SERPENT text (or Browse to the file) on the left and click on "Plot from input file". 
Don't forget to choose the right code (MORET, SERPENT,...) on top of the page. 
This app also allow you to export the 3D modelisations into 3D files (.stl or .ply eg).

The test files are located in the input_files_public folder.
